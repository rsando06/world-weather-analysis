# World Weather Analysis

## Project Overview
Beta testers have recommended that a weather description be added to the weather data as well as being able to input statements to filter data based on their 
weather preferences, which will be used to identify travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta testers will then choose four cities and the Google Maps 
Directions API will be used to create a travel route between the cities as well as overlay a marker layer map.

1. Add weather description to weather data.
2. Obtain input statements to filter data based on weather preferences.
3. Use Google Maps Directions API to create travel route and marker layer map based on the tester's four cities of choice.

## Challenge Overview
This analysis was interesting to go through due to the use of API's. It also helped with understanding new functions such as to_numpy() and concat().
